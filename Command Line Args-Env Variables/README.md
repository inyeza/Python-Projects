# Command Line Arguments
- In Python, command-line arguments are values that are passed to a script or program when it is executed from the command line. These arguments provide a way to customize the behavior of the script or provide input data to the program. Python provides the `sys` module to access command-line arguments through the `sys.argv` list.

- Here's a basic overview of how command-line arguments work in Python:

`sys.argv`:

- `sys.argv` is a list in the `sys` module that contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.
- `sys.argv[0]` is the script name itself, and the rest of the elements in the list represent the arguments provided by the user.

# Environment Variables
Environment variables in Python serve as a way to configure and control the behavior of programs and scripts. They are variables outside the program that can be accessed by the program at runtime. These variables are set in the operating system environment and can be read by the Python script or program to adapt its behavior accordingly. Environment variables are often used for the following purposes:

**1. Configuration:**

**2. Security:**

**3. Portability:**

**4. Dynamic Configuration:**

**5. Compatibility:**

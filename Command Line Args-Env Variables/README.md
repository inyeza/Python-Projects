# Command Line Arguments
- 
- In Python, command-line arguments are values that are passed to a script or program when it is executed from the command line. These arguments provide a way to customize the behavior of the script or provide input data to the program. Python provides the sys module to access command-line arguments through the sys.argv list.

- Here's a basic overview of how command-line arguments work in Python:

`sys.argv`:

- `sys.argv` is a list in the `sys` module that contains the command-line arguments passed to the script.
- `sys.argv[0]` is the script name itself, and the rest of the elements in the list represent the arguments provided by the user.
